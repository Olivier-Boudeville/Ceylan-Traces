% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that Ceylan-Traces can be directly
% tested separately (i.e. without needing to install upper layers, i.e. software
% depending on it): emulates a user of the Traces library.

% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (in conf/rebar-for-testing.config.template), meant
% to be filled by information coming from GNUmakevars.inc.

% To be run through the 'test-hex-package' make target.

% Note that this testing relates just to the ability of bringing up the
% specified Traces version as a dependency; there is no actual test involved,
% i.e. no depending sources that would make use here of Traces.



% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.
%
% Implied:
% - {myriad, "MYRIAD_VERSION_FOR_REBAR"}
% - {wooper, "WOOPER_VERSION_FOR_REBAR3" }
%
{deps, [ {traces, "VERSION_FOR_REBAR3" } ] }.


% This testing just targets to trigger the build of Traces (and its Myriad and
% WOOPER dependencies), not of specific tests making use of it.

% With relx, only direct dependencies need to be listed, and version constraints
