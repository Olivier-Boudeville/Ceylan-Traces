% This is a (manually crafted) configuration file of rebar3, so that
% Ceylan-Traces can be directly tested separately (i.e. without needing to
% install upper layers, i.e. software depending on it): emulates a user of the
% Traces library.
%
% This is also a template, so that version numbers can be updated from a
% centralized place (namely GNUmakevars.inc).

% To be run through the 'test-hex-package' make target.

% Note that this testing relates just to the ability of bringing up the
% specified Traces version as a dependency (and its own dependencies); there is
% no actual test involved, i.e. no depending sources that would make use here of
% Traces.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.
%
% Implied:
% - {myriad, "MYRIAD_VERSION_FOR_REBAR"}
% - {wooper, "WOOPER_VERSION_FOR_REBAR3" }
%
{deps, [ {traces, "VERSION_FOR_REBAR3" } ] }.


% This testing just targets to trigger the build of Traces (and its Myriad and
% WOOPER dependencies), not of specific tests making use of it.
