% This module gathers all code that allows to lighten the trace macros for
% tests.
%
-module(traces_for_tests).


-export([ test_start/2, test_stop/2, test_immediate_stop/2,
		  test_stop_on_shell/2 ]).


-define( trace_emitter_categorization, "test.life-cycle" ).


% For test_info_fmt and al:
-include("traces_test_header.hrl").


% For TraceType:
-include("traces.hrl").


-include("class_TraceSupervisor.hrl").


-include("traces_test_footer.hrl").




% To be called from the counterpart macro.

% Here we disable explicitly the trapping of EXIT events, as a function run
% through "erl -eval" (like our tests) or through "erl -run" will be executed in
% a process which will silently trap EXIT events, which would mean that the
% crash of any process created from the test, even thanks to spawn_link, would
% most probably remain unnoticed (just leading to an EXIT message happily
% sitting in the mailbox of the test process).
%
% Returns TraceAggregatorPid.

	% create their own aggregator, should none by found) and with trace
	% supervisor (which expects a trace file to be already created at start-up).
