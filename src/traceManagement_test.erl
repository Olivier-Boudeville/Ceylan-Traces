% Unit tests for the implementation of trace management.
%
% See the following modules:
% - class_TraceAggregator
% - class_TraceSupervisor
%
% Note: trace services are among the most generic services offered, they are
% used in the vast majority of tests but this one, as the purpose of this test
% is actually to test traces by themselves (we cannot use the trace system to
% test the trace system!).
%
-module(traceManagement_test).



% Test target:
-include("traces_for_tests.hrl").



% Run the tests.
%
% Note: this test is among the only ones that do not use the trace
% functionalities for their own behaviours (since it is the subject of these
% tests).
